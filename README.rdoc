== Getting Started

DMPOnline is a Ruby on Rails application.  Further details on how to install Ruby on Rails applications 
are available from http://rubyonrails.org



After downloading, create a <tt>config/database.yml</tt> file based on the provided <tt>config/database_example.yml</tt> file.
Currently only MySQL databases are supported.

Edit the configuration files at <tt>config/environments</tt> to include your contact email addresses.

Edit the configuration setting <tt>config.action_mailer.default_url_options</tt> in <tt>config/application.rb</tt>

Edit values for <tt>config.mailer_sender</tt> and <tt>config.pepper</tt> in <tt>config/initializers/devise.rb</tt>

Set a secret token in <tt>config/initializers/secret_token.rb</tt>

You'll need to install gems, build the database and then start the server:

  $> bundle install
  $> rake db:setup
  $> rails server

The database seed data will give you three users:

admin@example.com:: Full system admin user
organisation@example.com:: A dummy organisation admin user
user@example.com:: A normal end user

The password for each of these is 'password'
